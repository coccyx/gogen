# Gogen UI Project Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Project Structure**
   - Created a React project with TypeScript
   - Set up the basic directory structure
   - Created component and page files
   - Set up routing with React Router

2. **API Integration**
   - Created an API client for interacting with the Gogen API
   - Defined TypeScript interfaces for API responses
   - Implemented functions for fetching configurations
   - Updated ExecutionPage to use real API calls instead of mock data
   - Tested API integration with the backend

3. **UI Components**
   - Created layout components (Navbar, Footer)
   - Created page components (Home, Configurations, ConfigurationDetail, Execution)
   - Implemented a terminal-like interface for execution results

4. **Documentation**
   - Created an OpenAPI specification for the Gogen API
   - Created a detailed requirements document
   - Created a README.md file

5. **Styling and Configuration**
   - Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration issues
   - Implemented custom color scheme
   - Created reusable component classes using Tailwind's @apply directive
   - Implemented responsive design principles

6. **UI Refinement**
   - Removed Cribl branding and messaging
   - Simplified the UI to focus on Gogen functionality
   - Replaced hero section with Gogen-specific messaging
   - Simplified navigation to only include Home for now
   - Added a table to display Gogen configurations from the API
   - Created configuration detail page with metadata and YAML display
   - Fixed UI loading issues by simplifying the styling approach

7. **WASM Integration**
   - Created a WASM integration module for executing Gogen configurations in the browser
   - Implemented error handling for WASM execution
   - Removed non-existent API execution mode
   - Added Go WASM runtime (wasm_exec.js) for proper WASM initialization
   - Fixed WASM module loading and execution
   - Implemented a virtual file system to pass configuration state to the WASM module
   - Added command-line arguments support for the WASM module
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback for WASM execution
   - Simplified WASM execution code for better maintainability

## What Needs to Be Fixed

1. **API Integration**
   - ✅ Replaced mock data with real API data in the ExecutionPage component
   - ✅ Added event count control for execution configuration
   - ✅ Tested API integration with the backend

2. **WASM Integration**
   - ✅ Implemented the actual integration with the Gogen WASM module
   - ✅ Removed references to non-existent API execution mode
   - ✅ Fixed WASM initialization with proper Go runtime
   - ✅ Implemented virtual file system for configuration state
   - ✅ Added command-line arguments support for the WASM module
   - ✅ Simplified WASM execution code for better maintainability

3. **Testing**
   - We need to implement unit tests for components
   - We need to set up mocks for the API client

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Replace mock data with real API data
2. ✅ Test API integration with the backend
3. ✅ Implement the WASM integration
4. Add unit tests
5. Refine the UI components
6. Add more features (filtering, sorting, etc.)
7. Enhance the execution page with real-time updates
8. Implement error handling and loading states
