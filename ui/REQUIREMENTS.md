# Gogen UI Requirements

## Overview
The Gogen UI is a React-based web application that provides a user interface for interacting with the Gogen API. The UI allows users to view, search, and execute Gogen configurations.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API and hooks
- **Routing**: React Router
- **API Client**: Axios
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Color Scheme
The UI will follow Cribl.io's color scheme, which includes:
- Primary colors: Deep blues and purples (#261926, #7f66ff)
- Secondary colors: Bright accents (#ff3399, #f25e65)
- Neutral colors: White and light grays (#ffffff, #f1f1f1)

## Features

### 1. Configuration List View
- Display a list of all available Gogen configurations
- Show configuration name and description
- Allow sorting by name and description
- Provide a search box to filter configurations
- Include a button to execute a configuration

### 2. Configuration Detail View
- Display the full details of a selected configuration
- Show the configuration in a pretty-printed format
- Provide a button to execute the configuration
- Include a "Back to List" button

### 3. Configuration Execution
- Allow users to execute a configuration in the browser using the Gogen WASM module
- Provide options to configure the execution (based on available options in the configuration)
- Display execution results in one of two ways:
  - Terminal-like output (using xterm.js)
  - Structured event view for JSON output

## Pages

### 1. Home Page
- Welcome message and brief explanation of Gogen
- Quick links to the configuration list and other features

### 2. Configurations List Page
- List of all configurations with search and filter capabilities
- Each configuration item shows name, description, and an "Execute" button
- Clicking on a configuration name navigates to the detail view

### 3. Configuration Detail Page
- Detailed view of a single configuration
- Pretty-printed YAML/JSON display
- Execution options and controls

### 4. Execution Page
- Controls for configuring and running the selected configuration
- Output display area (terminal or structured view)
- Options to switch between output display modes

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Responsive Design
- The UI should be responsive and work well on mobile devices
- Layout should adapt to different screen sizes

### 2. Performance
- Fast loading times for the configuration list
- Efficient rendering of large configurations
- Smooth execution of configurations in the browser

### 3. Accessibility
- The UI should be accessible to users with disabilities
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines

### 4. Browser Compatibility
- Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Future Enhancements (Not in Initial Scope)
- User authentication via GitHub
- Creating and editing configurations
- Saving execution results
- Sharing configurations and results
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
