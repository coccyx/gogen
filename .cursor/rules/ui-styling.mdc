# Gogen UI Styling Rules

This document outlines the styling standards for the Gogen UI project.

## Tailwind CSS Usage

- Prefer standard Tailwind utility classes over custom classes when possible
- When custom classes are needed, define them in `index.css` using the `@apply` directive
- Document all custom colors and component classes in the README
- Use consistent spacing and sizing utilities

## Color Scheme

- Use the established color scheme defined in `tailwind.config.js`
- For primary actions: blue-800 backgrounds with white text
- For secondary actions: cyan-400 backgrounds with blue-900 text
- For UI structure: gray-100 for backgrounds, white for cards, gray-800 for footer
- For text: gray-800 for headings, gray-600 for body text

## Component Styling

- Use the following classes for buttons:
  - Primary: `bg-blue-800 text-white hover:bg-blue-700`
  - Secondary: `bg-cyan-400 text-blue-900 hover:bg-cyan-300`
  - Outline: `border border-blue-800 text-blue-800 hover:bg-blue-50`

- Use the following classes for cards:
  - `bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow`

- Use the following classes for tables:
  - Table: `min-w-full bg-white rounded-lg overflow-hidden shadow-md`
  - Header: `bg-gray-100 text-gray-700`
  - Rows: `hover:bg-gray-50 divide-y divide-gray-200`

## Responsive Design

- Use responsive utility classes (sm:, md:, lg:) for different screen sizes
- Ensure tables have overflow handling for smaller screens
- Use the container class with appropriate padding: `container mx-auto px-4`
- Design mobile-first, then add breakpoints for larger screens
