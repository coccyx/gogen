# Gogen UI Cursor Rules

This document outlines the standard rules for developing the Gogen UI project using Cursor.

## General Rules

- Keep components modular and focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Document code with clear comments
- Update SUMMARY.md after completing significant features

## Development Workflow

- After running the development server, verify UI is working as expected
- Use mock data during development until the actual API is ready
- Implement proper error handling for all async operations
- Test components in isolation before integration

## File Organization

- Place components in the `src/components` directory
- Place pages in the `src/pages` directory
- Place API clients in the `src/api` directory
- Place utility functions in the `src/utils` directory
- Place TypeScript interfaces in the `src/types` directory

## Development Server Verification

- After running the development server, always prompt the user to verify if the UI is working as expected
- Example prompt: "Is the UI loading correctly at http://localhost:3000? Are there any visual issues or console errors you're seeing?"
- Address any issues reported by the user before proceeding with further development
