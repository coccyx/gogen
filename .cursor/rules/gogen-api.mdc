# General Development Rules

- Keep components modular and focused on a single responsibility
- Document code with clear comments
- Update gogen-api/SUMMARY.md after completing significant features

## File Organization

- Each AWS Lambda function is a separate .py file in the `gogen-api` directory.
- Files were originally written in python2.7 but need to be updated to python3.
- APIs were originally implemented in 2017 and need to be updated to 2025 APIs.
